# Stochastic-Modeling-of-Health-Data

This project is the final project for my Stat 516 class, Stochastic Modeling of Scientific Data. In this project, I implemented the Hiden Markov Model in R to analyze the data, where an individual measures its daily average Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) with their smartwatch every day for 200 days.

I have included the final questions, the dataset, my code, and the result of my R Markdown file.
